# Burnout Predictor
This is an AI program trained on FER 2013 to analyze facial expressions and predict the user's risk for burnout.
## This data is the FER 2013 dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)
## What each file does
### burnout_predictor_model.pth
This is the pre-trained model.
### opencv_test.py
This is a test to check opencv functionality.
### trainingv2.py
This is the program to train the model.
### version5.py
This is the main program.
It got labeled as version5.py because when I started writing the program I was too dumb to learn Git properly first and just saved a bunch of checkpoints.
*face-palm*
